### Fraud Detection with Ensemble Models

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using a combination of advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. By analyzing real-world transaction data, we identified key behavioral patterns associated with fraud and trained an ensemble model that outperformed individual classifiers in both accuracy and recall. Feature engineering, handling imbalanced data using SMOTE, and evaluation with AUC-ROC were central to our approach.

Built an LSTM neural network to predict stock price movements based on historical data. The model was trained using sequences of past stock values and evaluated on its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data. Includes experiments with different lookback windows and dropout strategies.

Using sensor data from smartphones, this project classifies human activities (e.g., walking, sitting, standing) with an LSTM-based neural network. We compared deep learning performance with traditional machine learning techniques and found that LSTMs required minimal feature engineering while delivering strong results.
